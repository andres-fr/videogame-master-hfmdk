Actually you always draw with SpriteBatch, as Stage uses its own SpriteBatch. If you think you could
need some of the advantages of Scene2ds Stage, like Actions, Groups or other things, you should use
Stage. In my opinion it is really easy to use. You have your own objects, which extend Image or
Actor, override their update(delta) methods, where you check if the Actor should move (Keypressed
or an event for the AI). Also you should detect collisions there and take care about them. Then,
if you are extending Image you don't need to care about drawing (but Image needs Drawables so
you will have some problems with Animations), if you are extending Actor override the
draw(SpriteBatch batch), where you call batch.draw(...). Thats it. A big disadvantage of Stage
is the sorting. The Actor, which is drawn as first is in the background. The last Actor
overdraws all others and is in foreground. You can sort them by using the z-Index, but it is not
really sure. So you may decide to use your own kind of Stage (it is more or less a list, containing
all Actors, and when updateor draw is called, it is called for every Actor in this list), and add
your own sorting there. It depends on your game design, on your opinion and on your style. Look at
some tutorials/examples and decide how you want to create your game.
