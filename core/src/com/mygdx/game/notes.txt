TODO:
-> implement exp tensor function for player y-size
-> changing screen to new asset prevents smooth transition: in MainMenuScreen
stage.addAction(game.gotoScreen(new StreetChapter1Screen(game), 0.2f, 0.5f, true));

the instantiation of new Street... removes the current asset and therefore the fadeout is impossible!! fix that

-> make the player walk to the door before changing screen!!

-> add door in the room to get back to street

-> add pause menu efficiently

-> make the Player listener ignore the click if it was on an alpha pixel (so objects that are close to the head can be
clicked anyway)
