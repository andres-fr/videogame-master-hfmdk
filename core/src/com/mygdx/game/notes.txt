TODO:

-> Player speed and final position should adapt to resizing (they are buggy).

-> player should somehow delete all actions before starting a walk (it is buggy)

-> add dorm WZ

-> add pause menu efficiently

-> make the Player listener ignore the click if it was on an alpha pixel (so objects that are close to the head can be
clicked anyway)
